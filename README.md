This is a telegram bot that sends images from [rule34](rule34.xxx).

First of all, you need to replace the "BotToken" on the first line of "main.py" with your bot token.

Second of all, you need to install "requirements.txt".

The bot works like this:

If the command "/rule34" is typed, the bot will send a random image of the tag selected in the "Preference" variable.

The "Preference" variable is in the second line of "main.py" and can be changed (The default one is female).

If the command "/rule34 somebody" is typed, the bot will send a random image of the tag "somebody" instead of the preferenced tag.

Example:

User: /rule34 makima

Bot: "Sends a picture of Makima"
