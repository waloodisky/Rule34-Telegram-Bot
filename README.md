## A telegram bot that sends images from [rule34](https://rule34.xxx).

**First of all, you need to replace the "BotToken" on the first line of [main.py](main.py) with your bot token.**

**Second of all, you need to install "requirements.txt".**

### The bot works like this:
**If the command "/rule34" is typed, the bot will send a random image of the tag selected in the "Preference" variable.**

**The "Preference" variable is in the second line of [main.py](main.py) and can be changed (The default one is female).**

**If the command "/rule34 somebody" is typed, the bot will send a random image of the tag "somebody" instead of the preferenced tag.**

### Usage examples:

> **User**: /rule34

> **Bot**: "Sends a picture of the preferenced tag"

> **User**: /rule34 makima

> **Bot**: "Sends a picture of Makima"
