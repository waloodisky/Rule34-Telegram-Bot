This is a telegram bot that sends images from rule34.xxx and it works like this:

If the command "/rule34" is typed, the bot will send a random image of the tag selected in the "Preference" variable.

The "Preference" variable is in the second line of main.py and can be changed (The default one is female).

If the command "/rule34 somebody" is typed, the bot will send a random image of the tag "somebody" instead of the preferenced tag.
Example:
User: /rule34 makima
Bot: "Sends a picture of Makima"
